#What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby?
#Think of as many as you can.
#My answer:
# The real advantage of OOP versus percedural programming is the benefit
# of encapsulation. The entire program's runnability is not contingent
# on each line. Methods and ideas can be neatly organized into classes
#and modules. Futhremore, there is the benefit of inheritance.
#With OOP, a single method in a module or Superclass can trickle down into
#other classes via inheritance or mixins. Moreover, there is namespacing.
#If you have several similiar classes, those can then further be encanpsulated
#into a single module, therefore organizing all of them into a single accessible
#place.

#LS Answer:


# Because there are so many benefits to using OOP we will just summarize some of
# the major ones:

#     Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
#     Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
#     It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace issues are much harder to come across.
#     It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without duplication.
#     We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
#     As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
